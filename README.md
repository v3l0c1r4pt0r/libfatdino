==========

libfatdino is a Linux library to handle FAT32 volumes using block device or image file as input. It as of now contains 
functions to read/write to FAT32 filesystem with brief description about every function and its return value. There is
also example application that uses each function and can be used as hint on how to use these functions. Finally there is
makefile that is able to compile the library and this demo app using static or dynamic linking (and in the second case 
generate .so file).
